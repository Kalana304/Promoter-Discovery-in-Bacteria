# Promoter Discovery in Bacteria using Statistical Gene Prediction
This aims at finding promoters within a given set of genomes of Escherichia coli bacteria using statistical gene prediction methods. This is performed as a partial requirement for the BM4321 - Genomic Signal Processing during the senior year at University of Moratuwa.

The complete genomes of Escherichia coli bacteria in their FASTA format can be accessed in this [folder](https://github.com/Kalana304/Promoter-Discovery-in-Bacteria/tree/main/Genomes). The corresponding protein tables are provided in this [folder](https://github.com/Kalana304/Promoter-Discovery-in-Bacteria/tree/main/ProteinTables). You can access the genomes and protein tables by visiting [NCIB](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/) Genome Website.
